Currently I'm exploring the world of security engineering with a special interest in adversarial machine learning.

Hi, my name is David. I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/nc/en/homepage/). 

<!-- 
I'm most interested in the process of converting ideas into deployable software. Find out what I'm up to by taking a look at my [blog](http://davidglavas.me/blog/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/davidglavas) page.

In my spare time I enjoy delving into unfamiliar topics. I feel an unreasonable amount of joy while using tools in unconventional, yet effective ways for problems they weren't designed for---I once used a lighter to open a bottle of coke. Apart from coding I sleep, read, or spend time with friends.
