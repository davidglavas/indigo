Hi, my name is David. I'm a third year computer science undergraduate at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/nc/en/homepage/). 

I'm most interested in security engineering with a special interest in adversarial machine learning.

In my spare time enjoy delving into unfamiliar topics. I feel an unreasonable amount of joy when using tools in unconventional ways for problems they weren't designed for---I once used a lighter to open a bottle of coke. Apart from coding I sleep, read, or spend time with friends.
