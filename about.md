Hi, my name is David and I'm a third year computer science undergraduate at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/nc/en/homepage/). 

I'm most interested in security and machine learning. I enjoy delving into unfamiliar topics and feel an unreasonable amount of joy when using tools in unconventional ways for problems they weren't designed for.

In my spare time I code, ~~travel~~, or hang out with friends.
